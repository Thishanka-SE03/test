## FAQ

**Q: Why isn't EcoSphere showing my nearby collection points?**  
A: Make sure location permission is granted. Some regions may have incomplete map data — help us improve by contributing points!

**Q: How do rewards work?**  
A: Scan proof of recycling (photo / QR at station) → earn EcoPoints → redeem for partner perks or tree-planting donations.

**Q: Is my data private?**  
A: Yes — we only store what you explicitly share. No selling of personal data.
